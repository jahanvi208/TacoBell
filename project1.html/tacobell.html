        <h3><b> TACO TRIVIA </b></h3>
        <summery>where did the teco frist appear in United States?</summery>
        <details>
            <p>In fact, Americans first became exposed to tacos through Mexican food carts in Los Angeles that were run by women called “chili queens”. These ladies sold delicious economic Mexican food like soft corn tortilla tacos, and they were deemed exotic by any American that tried one. </p>
